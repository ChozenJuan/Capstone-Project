# The-Real-Dealer
The Real Dealer

To run this program, you will need to pip install scipy, numpy, treys, opencv-python, and serial. Thanks!

Currently, game.py, player.py, and main.py are used to excecute a poker simulation.

When the hardware is finalized, camera.py will take input from the Arduino Uno camera and determine what card is in the dealers deck. At this point, the deck class
will become obsilete.

av-distance.py contains basic information to determine the input for motion studies perfomed on this project, and has a simple shuffling algorithm to increase the 
efficency of our mechanism by decreasing the total distance that the servo must travel.
